    "To verify that the optimal tour is ABDECA with cost 20 using exact dynamic programming (DP) with starting city A, we can use the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the state space.** The state of the DP algorithm will be a tuple $(city, visitedSet)$, where $city$ is the current city and $visited_set$ is a set of cities that have already been visited. The initial state is `(A, {})`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define the transition function.** The transition function takes a state $(city, visitedSet)$ and returns a list of next states $(nextCity, visitedSetPrime)$, where $nextCity$ is a city that can be reached from $city$ and $visitedSetPrime$ is the updated set of visited cities. The cost of the transition is the travel time from $city$ to $nextCity$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define the base cases.** The base cases are when the visited set contains all cities except the start city. In this case, the only next state is to return to the start city. The cost of this transition is the travel time from the current city to the start city.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recursively solve the DP problem.** To solve the DP problem recursively, we can use the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dp(city, visitedSet) = min(dp(nextCity, visitedSetPrime) + cost(city, nextCity))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $(nextCity, visitedSetPrime)$ is a next state of $(city, visitedSet)$\n",
    "and $cost(city, nextCity)$ is the travel time from $city$ to $nextCity$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return the optimal solution.** The optimal solution is the minimum cost of a tour that starts at city A and visits all cities exactly once. This can be found by taking the minimum over all states where the visited set contains all cities except the start city.\n",
